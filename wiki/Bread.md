This is the full list of all the nation exclusively on vitae that have been made by Ak (AKAwesomeGamer/Manager_at_the_bread_store)
•1. New France, this rendition was back in 2018-2019 On the xanez earth server. It would be the birth Of New France and the template for this nation Would be use later on in other servers
•2. French empire, this rendition was the First 
Nation made by ak on any of the vitae servers
This server was vitae earth realm v1
•3. Francotyska, this rendition was originally on Chronocraft but moved to vitae earth realm v2. It was the nation that tried to merge with Britain which caused major backlash and almost started a whole server war
•4. French Empire v2, this rendition was the second version of the French empire on vitae earth realm v2. It would later become the most hated nation on the server due to its colonies, although the places they were colonizing were small and in unclaimed spaces people still had massive hate and started a war with all the nations against French empire until the empire gave up its colonies and then eventually had to give up its land as a whole.
•5. New France, this Rendition was the first instance of New France on a vitae realm, it appeared on vitae earth v2,
It didn’t last for long but it did have a decent sized claim in Quebec.
•6. New France, this was the 2 instance of née France on a vitae realm and it was on the vitae earth realm v3 owned by ak himself. There is a lot of controversy around this claim because at the end of the server right before it was about to reset ak decided to claim a massive amount of land.
•7. Carrot kingdom, this was more of a joke nation the the Pangea smp server run by ak
•8. Texan empire, this was another large empire that didn’t last for long before it was blown up by withers
•9. Roman Empire, this was the first Roman Empire ever on vitae.
That’s all the past nations but with ak back on vitae and vitae coming out with a new server the list could grow
Bonus: At one point a secret Rèvolution was started which gave ak a unofficial claim that lasted a week.
